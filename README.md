Developing a seamless and exclusive campaign for a limited-time drop of 25 one-of-a-kind, patented color-changing high-end jewelry rings, with challenges in access control, user engagement, secure transactions, and post-purchase engagement—all within a tight 36-hour deadline.

Solution
Solution:
Created a WordPress-based landing page with the following features:

Luxurious User Experience: Designed a landing page reflecting luxury and interactivity with the Nunito Sans font and brand colors, integrated a magic-themed cursor, branded loading page, and an introductory video with Arabic subtitles.

Secure Payment: Integrated Stripe for secure transactions, including referral code input and space for special requests.

Post-Purchase Engagement: Developed a platform for order tracking, customer interaction, and a points-based referral system, keeping customers engaged post-purchase.

Timely Execution: Completed the project within 36 hours, using WordPress and plugins for rapid development while maintaining high quality.

Impact
Exclusive Access: Ensured only pre-selected customers could access the drop.
Engaging Experience: Delivered a luxurious and interactive user experience.
Secure Transactions: Facilitated secure payments through Stripe.
Customer Engagement: Fostered ongoing customer engagement with post-purchase features.
Successful Execution: Delivered a fully functional landing page within the tight deadline.
This solution effectively met the project’s objectives, ensuring a successful and exclusive product drop.


How I Built the Landing Page
1. Design Planning with Figma:

Design Layout: Started with Figma to create a visual blueprint of the landing page, ensuring it aligned with the brand's luxury aesthetic.
Typography & Colors: Applied the Nunito Sans font and brand colors (Pantone P106-14C for blue) in the design. Incorporated elements like a magic-themed cursor and branded loading page.
User Flow: Mapped out user interactions, including login prompts and post-purchase engagement.
2. Setting Up WordPress:

Install WordPress: Set up a new WordPress site on a local or staging environment.
Theme Selection: Chose a clean, customizable theme compatible with WooCommerce and Ultimate Member.
3. Implementing the Design:

Customizing the Theme: Used the WordPress Customizer to align the theme’s look with the Figma design, ensuring consistency in fonts, colors, and layout.
Creating Pages: Added the necessary pages:
Landing Page: Included video, product details, countdown timer, and a Stripe-integrated payment section.
Post-Purchase Page: Set up a thank-you page with order tracking and customer engagement options.
Navigation Menu: Added menu items like Profile Details, Orders, Points, and Membership Benefits.
4. Adding the Login System:

Ultimate Member Plugin: Installed and configured Ultimate Member to manage user registration, login, and access control.
Login Button in Navbar: Used the plugin settings to add a login button in the navbar, ensuring users must log in before adding products to the cart.
Redirect on Add to Cart: Configured WooCommerce to redirect users to the login page if they try to add a product without being logged in.
5. Payment Integration:

Stripe Plugin: Installed and set up the Stripe payment gateway for secure transactions, ensuring the payment process matched the Figma design.
Post-Purchase Redirection: Configured Stripe to redirect users back to the landing page post-payment, where they could access exclusive content.
6. Final Testing and Launch:

Cross-Device Testing: Ensured the site was fully responsive and worked smoothly across all devices.
Functionality Checks: Tested login, payment, and post-purchase features to ensure they were functioning correctly before the final launch.
By following these steps, I was able to translate the Figma design into a fully functional, engaging WordPress landing page within the 36-hour deadline.
